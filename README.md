# OddNumbers
This program in C# asks the user to input a starting number and an ending number, and then it calculates the number of odd numbers in that range. It creates an array of the appropriate size to store these odd numbers and fills the array with the odd numbers using a loop. Finally, it prints the array of odd numbers to the console.
